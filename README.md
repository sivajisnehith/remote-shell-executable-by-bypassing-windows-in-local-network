## 🛡️ Windows Security Notice

This project is **not code-signed**, and as a result, Windows may display an **“Unknown Publisher”** warning when executing the installer or binary.

This is expected behavior for unsigned research utilities.

## 🚧 Project Status

> **Work in Progress**

VantaBlack is currently under active development.  
Core functionality is implemented; however, **advanced stealth-related features are still in progress** and will be added in future updates.

## 🔐 Installer / Archive Access

To inspect the installer or executable:

- **Archive password (Smart Update):** `1234`

## 🔨 Build Instructions (Developer)

To maximize performance and reduce runtime dependencies, VantaBlack is compiled into a **native machine-code binary** using the **Nuitka optimizing compiler**.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Nuitka**
```bash
pip install nuitka

### Compilation Command

Run the following command in your terminal to generate the production-ready binary:

```bash
python -m nuitka \
  --onefile \
  --windows-disable-console \
  --include-package=requests \
  --remove-output \
  --product-name="VantaBlack Core" \
  --file-description="Network Diagnostics Utility" \
  Vantablack.py

## 🏷️ Flag Explanations (README section)

```markdown
### Flag Explanations

- `--onefile`  
  Packages the entire application into a single, portable executable.

- `--windows-disable-console`  
  Prevents a visible console window from appearing during execution.

- `--include-package=requests`  
  Ensures the `requests` library is bundled correctly and avoids hidden-import issues.

- `--remove-output`  
  Removes temporary C++ build files after compilation is complete.

- `--product-name`  
  Sets the product name shown in Windows file properties.

- `--file-description`  
  Adds a descriptive label under file details, making the executable appear as a legitimate utility.
